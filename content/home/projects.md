## Online harms

Risks and harms online are dangerous: misinformation, propaganda, bullying, abuse. We research data and methods for detecting and analysing harms.

## Efficient machine learning

We shouldn't need to burn the earth down to process text, especially with today's efficient computers. We research into efficient methods for NLP and mahcine learning, making them faster and greener.

## [Clinical NLP](project/clinical)

Our research into clinical text processing covers both automatic reading of clinical journals and text processing to support public health and diagnoses.

## [NLP for Danish](project/danish)

Danish speakers should have access to good language technology. We contribute our part for Danish NLP research.
