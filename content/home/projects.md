## Research themes

# Online harms

We research into risks and harms online: misinformation, propaganda, bullying, abusive language, and so on. Our research covers data creation, machine learning methods, and possible interventions.

# Efficient machine learning

We shouldn't need to burn the earth down to process text, especially with today's efficient computers. We research into efficient methods for NLP and mahcine learning, making them faster and greener.

# [Clinical NLP](project/clinical)

Our research into clinical text processing covers both automatic reading of clinical journals and text processing to support public health and diagnoses.

# [NLP for Danish](project/danish)

Denmark isn't large, so Danish speakers won't have access to the same technology as English users do without some serious work. We contribute our part for Danish NLP research.
