summary: "Towards Shareable Data in Clinical Natural Language Processing: Generating Synthetic Electronic Health Records"
abstract: "A serious obstacle to the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in the clinical domain is data accessibility. This problem could be tackled by using artificial medical data. In this talk, we will describe our current approach to generate synthetic electronic health records. We will also present the results of our preliminary assessment of the clinical validity and utility of these synthetic data for NLP."
