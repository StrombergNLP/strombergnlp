## [Danish Gigaword](https://gigaword.dk)

It’s hard to develop good tools processing Danish with computers when no large and wide-coverage dataset of Danish text is readily available. To address this, the Danish Gigaword Project (DAGW) maintains a corpus for Danish with over a billion words. 

See [gigaword.dk](https://gigaword.dk) for releases and further info.

## [LITHME](https://lithme.eu)

*EU COST, 80.000 DKK, 2020-2024*

LITHME is a COST Action network with members from every EU member state, plus a number of other countries outside the EU. Action chair: Dave Sayers (University of Jyväskylä).

Our aims:
* to prepare linguistics and its subdisciplines for what is coming;
* to facilitate longer term dialogue between linguists and technology developers.

## [NLPL](https://nlpl.eu)

*NordForsk/NeIC, 2017-2020*

The Nordic Language Processing Laboratory (NLPL) is a collaboration of university research groups in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Northern Europe. Our vision is to implement a virtual laboratory for large-scale NLP research by (a) creating new ways to enable data- and compute-intensive Natural Language Processing research by implementing a common software, data and service stack in multiple Nordic HPC centres, (b) by pooling competencies within the user community and among expert support teams, and (c) by enabling internationally competitive, data-intensive research and experimentation on a scale that would be difficult to sustain on commodity computing resources.
