## Verif-AI

*DFF, total 2,9M DKK, 2020-2022*

Verif-AI's central research question is: How can we scale AI-based verification of
claims made online? It takes a machine learning and natural language processing
approach to address this. The project researches multi-lingual fact extraction and
verification. We identify multi-linguality as a scaling bottleneck in automated fact
checking, and select fact verification as the route toward addressing propaganda
and misinformation.
