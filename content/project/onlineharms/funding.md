## Abusive Language Detection

*ITU Computer Science - internal, 285.000 DKK, 2020*

A project on automatic detection of bad online behaviour, including harassment, abusive language, and hate speech. The project goal is to build automatic systems and analyses for identifying this kind of behaviour, to be used to limit and address this problem by drawing attention to and allowing effective human moderation of these harmful social behaviours.

## Verif-AI

*DFF, total 2,9M DKK, 2020-2022*

Verif-AI's central research question is: How can we scale AI-based verification of
claims made online? It takes a machine learning and natural language processing
approach to address this. The project researches multi-lingual fact extraction and
verification. We identify multi-linguality as a scaling bottleneck in automated fact
checking, and select fact verification as the route toward addressing propaganda
and misinformation.

## Multi-Stance

*ITU Computer Science - internal, $43,000 USD, 2019-2020*

While many pieces of misinformation can be spotted through their origin or comparison with an external source, emerging and fringe information is harder to ground and verify. This means that not all emerging claims can be checked, leading to a gap where misinformation and manipulation may exist undisturbed. This gap should be addressed.
