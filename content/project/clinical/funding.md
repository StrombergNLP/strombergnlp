## ClinRead

*Novo Nordisk Foundation, total 543.794 DKK, 2020-2021*

ClinRead applies modern artificial intelligence techniques in the subfield of natural language
processing to map the techniques and advances available in privileged languages (e.g. English) to
clinical notes written in other languages. This will be done via a technique known as transfer learning.
The success of the approach will be validated in the first instance against de-identified Danish clinical
notes, an under-privileged language in terms of available technology. If successful, the resulting
technology gives a route to significantly reducing the barriers in introducing clinical natural language
processing to new languages.

## DANGER

*Aage og Johann Louis-Hansens Fond, total 2.500.000 DKK, 2021-2024*

We intend to explore the idea of using uncalibrated and implicitly calibrated eye tracking for people with disabilities (in particular ALS and elderly). This also includes development of new techniques (e.g. deep learning) to robustly find relevant eye features.
