abstract: "Clinical TempEval 2015 brought the temporal information extraction tasks of past TempEval campaigns to the clinical domain. Nine
sub-tasks were included, covering problems in
time expression identification, event expression
identification and temporal relation identification. Participant systems were trained and evaluated on a corpus of clinical notes and pathology reports from the Mayo Clinic, annotated
with an extension of TimeML for the clinical
domain. Three teams submitted a total of 13
system runs, with the best systems achieving
near-human performance on identifying events
and times, but with a large performance gap
still remaining for temporal relations."
