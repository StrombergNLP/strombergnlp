abstract: "Annotating the semantics of time in language is important. THYME (Styler et al., 2014) is a recent temporal annotation standard for clinical texts. This paper examines temporal expressions in the first major corpus released under this standard. It investigates where the standard has proven difficult to apply, and gives a series of recommendations regarding temporal annotation in this important domain."
