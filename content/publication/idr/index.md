abstract: "This paper presents a framework of opportunities and barriers/risks between the two research
fields Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The
framework is constructed by following an interdisciplinary research-model (IDR), combining
field-specific knowledge with existing work in
the two fields. The resulting framework is intended as a departure point for discussion and
inspiration for research collaborations."
