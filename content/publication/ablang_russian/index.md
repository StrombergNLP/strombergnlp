abstract: "Abusive phenomena are commonplace in language on the web. The scope of recognizing abusive language is broad, covering many
behaviours and forms of expression. This
work addresses automatic detection of abusive
language in Russian. The lexical, grammatical and morphological diversity of Russian
language present potential difficulties for this
task, which is addressed using a variety of
machine learning approaches. We present a
dataset and baselines for this task."
