abstract: "Improvements in machine learning-based NLP performance are often presented with bigger models and more complex code. This presents a trade-off: better scores come at the cost of larger tools; bigger models tend to require more during training and inference time. We present multiple methods for measuring the size of a model, and for comparing this with the model's performance. In a case study over part-of-speech tagging, we then apply these techniques to taggers for eight languages and present a novel analysis identifying which taggers are size-performance optimal. Results indicate that some classical taggers place on the size-performance skyline across languages. Further, although the deep models have highest performance for multiple scores, it is often not the most complex of these that reach peak performance."
