abstract: "Automatic detection of false claims is a
difficult task. Existing data to support
this task has largely been limited to English. We present a dataset, DANFEVER,
intended for claim verification in Danish.
The dataset builds upon the task framing
of the FEVER fact extraction and verification challenge. DANFEVER can be used
for creating models for detecting mis- &
disinformation in Danish as well as for
verification in multilingual settings."
