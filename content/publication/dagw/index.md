abstract: "Danish language technology has been hindered by a lack of broad-coverage corpora
at the scale modern NLP prefers. This paper describes the Danish Gigaword Corpus,
the result of a focused effort to provide a diverse and freely-available one billion word
corpus of Danish text. The Danish Gigaword corpus covers a wide array of time periods, domains, speakers’ socio-economic
status, and Danish dialects."
